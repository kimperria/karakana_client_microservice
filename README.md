## Introduction
---
**Karakana** is a swahili word that translates to Workshop. Although still a work in progress, *Karakana* is a web application that connects users, willing traders to lease/rent/hire commercial tools for manufacturing and production.

Inspired by DIY creatives and craftsmen/women with limited resources this project seek to provide a platform that will enable and faciliate exchange of, labor and expertise among other production resources.

## Problem Statement

Over the recent years, the world has experienced a rapid growth of the Do It Yourself  famously dubbed the D.I.Y movement. This wave has brought together a community of like minded individuals of all professional levels to try their crafts. 
We are a platform to help address the 3 main limitations of D.I.Y i.e high cost of production, poor production and time wastage.

### Developement progress
Currently working on display wireframes, UI/UX and user authentication.
